<ul>
  <li>Contains implemented car driving mechanics, like acceleration and friction and rotates using basic trigonometry</li>
  <li>Simulated sensors for collision detection, using segment intersection and linear interpolation</li>
  <li>Self-driving car using a simple neural network consisted of 3 layers (input layer, hidden layer, and output layer)</li>
  <li>Used a genetic algorithm to mutate when testing over 6000+ cars before finding one that avoided all obstacles without crashing </li>
</ul>
